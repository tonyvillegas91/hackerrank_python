Objective
Integers in Python can be as big as the bytes in your machine’s memory. There is no limit in size as there is:231 – 1  (c++ int) or 263 – 1 (C++ long long int).

As we know, the result of ab grows really fast with increasing b.

Let’s do some calculations on very large integers.

Task
Read four numbers, a, b, c, and d, and print the result of ab + cd.

Input Format
Integers a, b, c, and d are given on four separate lines, respectively.

Constraints
1 <= a <= 1000
1 <= b <= 1000
1 <= c <= 1000
1 <= d <= 1000
Output Format
Print the result of ab + cd on one line.

Sample Input

9
29
7
27
Sample Output

4710194409608608369201743232  
Note: This result is bigger than 263 – 1. Hence, it won’t fit in the long long int of C++ or a 64-bit integer.
